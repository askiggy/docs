Iggy is a data enrichment platform that provides location features to better understand our world. We source, clean, and normalize location data to produce a features dataset so that you can spend more time modeling and less time preparing data.

# What data does Iggy have?

We have over 100 different datasets for everything from hospitals and bars to current wildfires and census demographic data data.

# Where does Iggy get its Datasets?

Many Datasets are sourced from government agencies, open data communities, or vendors and are documented as such. Other Datasets are created in-house by the Iggy team.
